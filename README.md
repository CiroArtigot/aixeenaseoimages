# Aixeena SEO Images
Aixeena SEO Images is a plugin to minimize the weight of the images of your Joomla.

With this plugin you can get better results in the performance of your website, because it creates thumbnails of your images, reducing their size and quality.

It works with jpeg and png images, you can minize the size and the quality.

The thumbs are stored on a local folder (images/thumbs/ by default) and repalced on the page content.

The plugin only work with local images.

You can set the default images qualities and maximum image size, and you can set the default thumb directory.

This plugin is thinked for developers so by default you must add some tag classes to make it work. You can also disable de option "A Class is mandatory" to minimize all the page images.

The plugin works also with <img> tags and with style="background-image:url(), it can resize both of them.

# Mandatory classes:

In the option "A class is mandatory" is enabled (itÂ´s by default) is mandatory to add some classes to the <img> or to the element with the style.

To minimize an image you must add the "aixeena-images" class.

To set the maximun size enter the "size-200" (to set the maximum size to 200px). This way you can resize by code each image in a different size. You can have different views for different displais (mobile, desktop...)

To override the default quality you can use the "quality-80" to, for example set the quality to 80%.
